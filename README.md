Employee Database Queries

The purpose of this assignment was to show our mastery of SQL as a programming language.
This assignment first involved creating a ERD diagram to show how the tables linked by primary & foreign keys.
After that, some queries were run to probe the data and draw conclusions.

There was also a bonus that involved making charts in order to show important relationships in the data.
