        The purpose of this homework assignment was to show our mastery of SQL as a programming language.
        <br>
        This assignment first involved creating a ERD diagram to show how we were going to link the tables by primary & foreign keys.
        <br>
        After that, some queries were run to probe the data and draw conclusions.
        <br>

        There was also a bonus that involved making charts in order to show important relationships in the data.
